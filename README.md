# python
These are example of Python usage base mostly on other online courses or examples.

* All transformers examples are extracted from the excellent [Lazy Programmer classes that I highly recommend](https://lazyprogrammer.me)
* A 3D library server for use in any applicatioon using telnet: support for 3D object with lighting and textures. Allow selection, rotation, scaling. All python source code provided.

The only original Python Project is inside "python_server" which is used to run Python code remotely using telnet.
