**Approval of Stock Option Grants**

The members of the Committee have determined that it is in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders to grant to the individuals identified below (together, the
“Grantees,” and each individually, a “Grantee”) a stock option (an “Option”) to purchase
shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Shares”) under the Company’s 2023 Equity
Incentive Plan (the “2023 Plan”), subject to and conditioned on each such Grantee’s prior
commencement of employment with the Company, execution and delivery of the
Company’s standard form of confidentiality and invention assignment agreement, as
applicable, and all other applicable employment documentation (the “Conditions
Precedent”). The Committee therefore resolves as follows:

- that in recognition of the Grantees’ valuable services to the Company, and subject
to full satisfaction of the Conditions Precedent, the Committee hereby grants to each
Grantee an Option, pursuant and subject to the terms and conditions of the 2023 Plan, for
the number of Shares having a fair value as of the Effective Grant Date set forth opposite
each such Grantee’s name below determined using the Black-Scholes option valuation
model, and subject to the other terms and conditions set forth opposite each such

# 5b - PCCC Charter


-----

**PEOPLE, CULTURE AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE CHARTER**

**PURPOSE**

The People, Culture and Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) is a standing committee of
the Board of Directors of lululemon athletica inc. (the “Company”). The purpose of the
Committee is to (1) discharge the responsibilities as delegated by the Board of Directors relating
to compensation of independent members of the Board of Directors, the Company’s chief
executive officer (“CEO”), and the executive officers of the Company; (2) to assist the Board of
Directors in establishing incentive compensation and equity-based plans and programs and
administer those plans and programs; and (3) to perform such other duties and responsibilities
specified in and consistent with this charter.

**MEMBERSHIP**

Membership on the Committee shall be determined by the Board of Directors upon the
recommendation of the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability and Governance Committee (the
“CRSG Committee”). Committee members shall serve until their successors shall be duly elected
and qualified. Unless a chairperson of the Committee is elected by the Board of Directors, the
members of the Committee may designate a chairperson of the Committee by majority vote of
the full Committee membership. The Board of Directors, in consultation with the CRSG
Committee, may remove the entire Committee or any individual member of the Committee at
any time with or without cause and may appoint an independent director to fill the vacancy for
the remainder of the term.

The Committee shall be comprised of at least three members, each of whom shall meet the
independence requirements of applicable law and the listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock
Market, in each case as determined by the Board of Directors. Unless otherwise determined by
the Board of Directors, each member of the Committee must also meet the requirements of a
“non-employee director” for purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

**MEETINGS**

   - The Committee’s chairperson (or in his or her absence, a member designated by the
Committee’s chairperson) shall preside at each meeting of the Committee and set the
agendas for Committee meetings. The Committee shall have the authority to establish its
own rules and procedures for notice and conduct of its meetings so long as they are not
inconsistent with the provisions of the Company’s bylaws that are applicable to a
committee of the Board of Directors.


-----

necessary to carry out its responsibilities. Any member of the Committee may call a
special meeting of the Committee. Meetings of the Committee may be held in-person or
via telephonic or video conference.

   - Except as otherwise provided by statute or this Charter, a majority of the members of the
Committee shall be required to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any
meeting, and the act of a majority of the Committee members present and voting at any
meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Committee. Any action
required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Committee may be taken without
a meeting if all members of the Committee consent thereto in writing or by electronic
transmission. All such writings or electronic transmissions shall be filed with the minutes
of proceedings of the Committee.

   - The Committee may, in its discretion, invite other directors of the Company, members of
the Company’s management, or any other person whose presence the Committee believes
to be desirable and appropriate to attend and observe meetings of the Committee.
Individuals who are invited to attend meetings of the Committee shall (a) not participate
in any discussion or deliberation of the Committee unless invited to do so by the
Committee, and (b) not be entitled to vote on any matter brought before the Committee.
The Committee may exclude from its meetings any person it deems appropriate.

   - The Committee shall maintain minutes or other records of meetings and activities of the
Committee. Minutes of meetings of the Committee shall be distributed periodically to the
full Board of Directors.

   - All action taken by the Committee (or any subcommittee thereof) shall be reported to the
Board of Directors at the next meeting of the Board of Directors following such action. In
addition, compensation matters may be discussed in executive session with the full Board
of Directors during the course of the year.

**COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY**

The Company’s compensation policies with respect to the executive officers of the Company are
based on the principles that compensation should encourage sustained long-term performance.
Compensation should, to a significant extent, be reflective of the financial performance of the
Company, aligned with shareholders, and a significant portion of executive officers’
compensation should be provided through long-term incentives. The Committee seeks to have
compensation of the Company’s executive officers set at levels that are competitive so that the
Company may attract, retain and motivate highly qualified executive officers to contribute to the
Company’s success. In assessing overall compensation for executive officers, the Committee will
consider (among other things) the Company’s performance, relative stockholder return and
industry position, market compensation data, awards given to the Company’s executive officers
in past years, and the recommendations of third-party consultants.

**DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES**


-----

responsibilities. These functions are set forth as a guide with the understanding that the
Committee may diverge from this guide as appropriate given the circumstances.

**Executive Compensation.**

 - The Committee shall periodically review and advise the Board of Directors
concerning the Company’s overall compensation philosophy, policies and plans,
including a review of executive compensation practices and trends in order to assess
the adequacy and competitiveness of the Company’s compensation programs for the
Company’s executive officers relative to comparable companies. The Committee shall
review and approve appropriate companies to comprise any peer group (or groups)
used for comparison purposes.

 - The Committee will review and recommend to the Board of Directors the
compensation and other terms of employment of the Company’s CEO and will
evaluate the CEO’s performance in light of relevant corporate performance goals and
objectives. In determining the long-term incentive component of the CEO’s
compensation, the Committee should seek to achieve an appropriate level of risk and
reward, taking into consideration the Company’s performance and relative
stockholder return, the potential benefits and costs to the Company of the award and
such other criteria as the Committee deems advisable. The CEO may not be present
during the voting or deliberations regarding his or her compensation.

 - The Committee will review and approve the corporate performance goals and
objectives related to the equity and incentive compensation of the Company’s other
executive officers (as that term is defined in Section 16 of the Exchange Act and Rule
16a-1 thereunder) and other senior management, as appropriate, that are periodically
established. The Committee will determine and approve all elements of the
compensation and other terms of employment of these executive officers and other
senior management, as appropriate. The Committee shall consult with, and take into
account the recommendations of the CEO with respect to any matters concerning the
performance and compensation of the Company’s executive vice presidents and other
direct reports of the CEO. The Committee may also review and approve any offers or
pay changes to other highly compensated executives the Committee may designate
from time to time. The CEO may be present during these deliberations.

  - The Committee shall review and recommend to the Board of Directors new or
amended executive compensation programs, conduct an annual review of the
operation of the Company’s executive compensation programs to determine whether
they are properly coordinated and achieving their intended purposes, support
organization objectives and stockholder interests, can create a pay for performance
linkage. The Committee will establish and periodically review policies for the
administration of the executive compensation programs.


-----

management perquisites and special benefits, and review and approve the benefits
provided to the Company’s executive officers.

**Director Compensation.**

Consistent with the executive compensation philosophy, the Committee seeks to have
compensation of the Company’s directors set at levels that are competitive so that the
Company may attract, and retain qualified candidates, and align our directors’ interest
with those of our shareholders.

The Committee shall advise the Board of Directors with respect to proposed changes in
the compensation of members of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof. In
considering director compensation, the Committee may take into consideration the
relative responsibilities of directors in serving on the Board of Directors and its various
committees. The Committee may request that management or outside advisors report to
the Committee periodically on the status of the Board of Directors’ compensation in
relation to other similarly situated companies. Directors who are Company employees
shall not be compensated for their services as a director of the Company.

**Benefit and Incentive Plans.**

The Committee shall review and approve material changes in the Company’s incentivecompensation plans, equity-based plans, deferred compensation plans and authorize and
approve significant changes in the design of the Company’s retirement and welfare benefit
plans, programs and arrangement, including, but not limited to, termination or adoption of
material benefits plans, programs, or arrangements that cover large employee populations
or that are primarily for the benefit of the Company’s executive officers or executive vice
presidents.

 - The Committee shall also review and make recommendations to the Board of
Directors with respect to the Company’s established criteria for the granting of
options and other stock-based awards to eligible participants under such plans,
including, without limitation, the Company’s executive officers and other employees;
review and approve the granting of options and other stock-based awards to eligible
participants under such plans; and supervise administration of such plans.

 - The Committee shall recommend to the Board of Directors the terms of any incentive,
equity or benefit plan that requires the approval of the Company’s stockholders,
including amendments thereof, and shall administer those plans on behalf of the
Board of Directors.

**Employment Agreements.**

The Committee shall review and recommend to the Board of Directors the terms of any
employment agreements, severance arrangements, change-of-control protections and any other


-----

the terms of any employment agreements, severance arrangements, change-of-control protections
and any other compensatory arrangements for the Company’s other executive officers and senior
management, as appropriate.

**Disclosure.**

 - The Committee shall review and discuss with management the Company’s disclosures
under the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” (the “CD&A”) portion of the
Company’s proxy statement relating to the annual meeting of stockholders, and based
on such review and discussion, make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as
to whether the CD&A should be included in the Company’s annual report on Form
10-K and the Company’s proxy statement.

 - The Committee shall produce an annual Report of the Compensation Committee for
the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K and the Company’s proxy statement, in
compliance with applicable rules and regulations.

 - The Committee shall review and make recommendations with respect to shareholder,
management and Board proposals on executive compensation matters. This includes
assessing the results of the Company’s advisory votes on executive compensation,
making executive compensation decisions as recommendations to the Board of
Directors based on those assessments, and making recommendations to the Board of
Directors related to the “say on pay” proposals required by Section 14A of the
Exchange Act.

**Compensation Policies and Practices Relative to Risk.**

 - The Committee shall periodically, but no less than annually, review the Company’s
compensation policies and practices to determine if there are risks presented that are
reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. This review will
also consider the risk mitigating processes, steps and controls that the Company has in
place.

 - The Committee shall determine whether disclosure of the Company’s compensation
policies and practices in this regard is required to be included in the Company’s proxy
statement under Item 402(s) of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act, and, if such
disclosure is required, shall review and discuss with management such disclosure and
shall make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether such disclosure
should be included in the Company’s proxy statement.

 - The Committee shall report to the Board of Directors the results of such evaluation
and determination.


-----

guidelines and recoupment policies for the Company’s executive officers and
nonemployee directors, and periodically assess such guidelines (including executive
and nonemployee director progress toward the guidelines) and policies and
recommend revisions, as appropriate.

**Talent Management and Succession Planning.**

The Committee shall review with management, at least annually, a detailed report on succession
planning and talent management that covers: the programs that support the growth and
development of our current and future generations of leaders and our bench strength including
identification of potential successors for each executive role, as well as other roles that are
critical to the Company’s success (including for the CEO in the case of an emergency). The
Committee will also provide a report to the full Board annually on these matters.

**Diversity and Inclusion.**

The Committee shall periodically review with management the Company’s policies and practices
with respect to diversity and inclusion.

**Committee Review.**

The Committee shall conduct an annual review and evaluation of its own performance. The
Committee shall report to the Board of Directors the results of such annual performance
evaluation, which shall include a comparison of the performance of the Committee with the
requirements of this Charter.

**Charter Review.**

The Committee shall conduct an annual assessment of the adequacy of this Charter and annually
recommend any proposed changes to the Board of Directors for approval.

**Investigation of Other Matters.**

In discharging its oversight role, the Committee is empowered to investigate any matter brought
to its attention.

**Stockholder Proposals.**

The Committee shall review and make recommendations to the Board of Directors with respect
to management’s recommendations with respect to any stockholder proposals primarily
addressing executive compensation matters for the Company’s proxy materials.

**ACCESS TO RECORDS AND RESOURCES**

The Committee will have the resources and authority necessary to discharge its duties and
responsibilities. In carrying out its duties and responsibilities, the Committee shall have full
access to any relevant records of the Company and may retain experts and outside consultants or


-----

and assistance from internal or external legal, accounting or other advisors. The Committee shall
have sole authority to engage, terminate and determine the independence, compensation and
terms of engagement of any experts, outside consultants, external legal counsel, accounting or
other advisors. Prior to selecting, or receiving advice from, any advisor, the Committee shall
consider the independence of such advisor based on the independence factors listed in Nasdaq
Rule 5605(d)(3); provided, however, that the Committee shall not be prohibited from obtaining
advice from advisors that it determines are not independent. The Committee may also request
that any officer or other employee of the Company, the Company’s outside counsel or any other
person meet with any members of, or consultants to, the Committee. The fees, expenses or
compensation owed to any person retained by the Committee and any ordinary administrative
expenses of the Committee incurred in carrying out its duties and responsibilities shall be borne
by the Company.

Any communications between the Committee and legal counsel in the course of obtaining legal
advice will be considered privileged communications of the Company and the Committee will
take all necessary steps to preserve the privileged nature of those communications.

**DELEGATION OF DUTIES**

The Committee shall be entitled to delegate any or all of its duties or responsibilities to a
subcommittee of the Committee, to the extent consistent with the Company’s certificate of
incorporation, bylaws, and applicable laws and rules of the markets in which the Company’s
securities then trade. In addition, the Committee may authorize a person or body to (i) designate
eligible individuals other than executive officers and directors to be the recipients of equity
compensation and (ii) determine, within the parameters established by the Committee or the
Board of Directors, the size and terms of equity awards to be granted to each such recipient, to
the extent consistent with the Company’s certificate of incorporation, bylaws, and applicable
laws and rules of the markets in which the Company’s securities then trade; provided, however,
that no officer may designate himself or herself as such a recipient. Any officer to whom such
authority is delegated shall regularly report to the Committee on the grants so made. To the
extent necessary to comply with Rule 16b-3, the “non-employee directors,” acting as a
subcommittee, shall have authority to act on behalf of the Committee.
